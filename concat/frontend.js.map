This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

The `iteratee` is bound to `thisArg` and invoked with three\n * arguments: (value, index, array).\n *\n * If a property name is provided for `iteratee` the created `_.property`\n * style callback returns the property value of the given element.\n *\n * If a value is also provided for `thisArg` the created `_.matchesProperty`\n * style callback returns `true` for elements that have a matching property\n * value, else `false`.\n *\n * If an object is provided for `iteratee` the created `_.matches` style\n * callback returns `true` for elements that have the properties of the given\n * object, else `false`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @alias unique\n * @category Array\n * @param {Array} array The array to inspect.\n * @param {boolean} [isSorted] Specify the array is sorted.\n * @param {Function|Object|string} [iteratee] The function invoked per iteration.\n * @param {*} [thisArg] The `this` binding of `iteratee`.\n * @returns {Array} Returns the new duplicate-value-free array.\n * @example\n *\n * _.uniq([2, 1, 2]);\n * // => [2, 1]\n *\n * // using `isSorted`\n * _.uniq([1, 1, 2], true);\n * // => [1, 2]\n *\n * // using an iteratee function\n * _.uniq([1, 2.5, 1.5, 2], function(n) {\n *   return this.floor(n);\n * }, Math);\n * // => [1, 2.5]\n *\n * // using the `_.property` callback shorthand\n * _.uniq([{ 'x': 1 }, { 'x': 2 }, { 'x': 1 }], 'x');\n * // => [{ 'x': 1 }, { 'x': 2 }]\n */\nfunction uniq(array, isSorted, iteratee, thisArg) {\n  var length = array ? array.length : 0;\n  if (!length) {\n    return [];\n  }\n  if (isSorted != null && typeof isSorted != 'boolean') {\n    thisArg = iteratee;\n    iteratee = isIterateeCall(array, isSorted, thisArg) ? undefined : isSorted;\n    isSorted = false;\n  }\n  iteratee = iteratee == null ? iteratee : baseCallback(iteratee, thisArg, 3);\n  return (isSorted)\n    ? sortedUniq(array, iteratee)\n    : baseUniq(array, iteratee);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = uniq;\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/lodash/array/uniq.js\n// module id = 225\n// module chunks = 0","var baseIndexOf = require('./baseIndexOf'),\n    cacheIndexOf = require('./cacheIndexOf'),\n    createCache = require('./createCache');\n\n/** Used as the size to enable large array optimizations. */\nvar LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE = 200;\n\n/**\n * The base implementation of `_.uniq` without support for callback shorthands\n * and `this` binding.\n *\n * @private\n * @param {Array} array The array to inspect.\n * @param {Function} [iteratee] The function invoked per iteration.\n * @returns {Array} Returns the new duplicate free array.\n */\nfunction baseUniq(array, iteratee) {\n  var index = -1,\n      indexOf = baseIndexOf,\n      length = array.length,\n      isCommon = true,\n      isLarge = isCommon && length >= LARGE_ARRAY_SIZE,\n      seen = isLarge ? createCache() : null,\n      result = [];\n\n  if (seen) {\n    indexOf = cacheIndexOf;\n    isCommon = false;\n  } else {\n    isLarge = false;\n    seen = iteratee ?
